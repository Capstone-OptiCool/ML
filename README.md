## About 
We have model, eyeglassess frame, and recomendation algorithm in this repository
### Face Shape Classifier
- [FaceShape Classifier ](https://github.com/Capstone-OptiCool/ML/blob/main/face_shape_classifier_fix.ipynb) 
(image classification) use MobileNet as the base model for transfer learning that is taken from [Keras](https://keras.io/api/applications/inceptionv3/). The model also contains an additional layer that received output from the based model. We use datasets [Face Shape Image Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alinedobrovsky/plant-disease-classification-merged-dataset) that contains 3,981 face images.
